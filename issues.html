            <h2>River Bank Erosion</h2>
            <p>
              Riverbank erosion caused by successive heavy rain events and
              cyclones over recent years is a major issue in the Coromandel.
              Land along river banks, known as riparian zones act as natural
              filters that prevent sediment and nutrients from entering the
              waterways, improving water quality and providing a habitat for
              wildlife and plants to live in. Thanks to this, riparian zones
              offer great recreational and scenic value for visitors to the
              Coromandel. However, flooding from the heavy rain events has
              caused river bank erosion and the loss of riparian zones across
              the Coromandel. The estimated cost due to damage from the flooding
              events in the Coromandel is nearly $18.5 million. This also has a
              lot of knock on effects in the surrounding area such as increased
              proneness to flooding, bad water quality and increased
              sedimentation.

            <h2>Sediment</h2>
            <p>
              Sediment, comprising soil, sand, or rock particles is a big issue
              in the Coromandel because it poses a significant threat to marine
              life and human activities alike. Caused by river bank erosion,
              sediment is transported via waterways and stormwater to coastal
              areas. Human interventions such as forestry, farming, and
              earthworks increase sedimentation rates, with estimates suggesting
              that New Zealand contributes approximately 7 million dump trucks'
              worth of sediment to the ocean annually. This sedimentation
              jeopardises ocean ecosystems by diminishing sunlight penetration
              essential for photosynthesis, hindering visibility crucial for
              hunting among marine species, and smothering plants and animals,
              thereby disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem.

            <h2>Scallops</h2>
            <p>
              An prime example of one of the knock on effects from river bank
              erosion and sedimentation is the issue of Coromandels scallop
              fisheries. A 50% reduction in scallops was seen in the Coromandel
              in 2016 and further surveys have shown a further decline in
              numbers. The loss can be blamed on fishing to some extent but the
              major factors causing the decline was river bank erosion causing
              sedimentation and bad water quality. This shows the domino effect
              that can happen to an ecosystem when just one part of it is
              knocked off balance and highlights the need for kaitiakitanga and
              traditional approaches to looking after our environment.
              Thankfully, the Coromandel is up to the challenge.
